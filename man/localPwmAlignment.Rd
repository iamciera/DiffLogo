\usage{
localPwmAlignment(pwm_left, pwm_right, divergence = shannonDivergence,
  unaligned_penalty = divergencePenaltyForUnaligned,
  try_reverse_complement = T, base_distribution = NULL,
  length_normalization = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{divergence}{is a measure of difference between two pwm columns. Smaller is more similar. If you want to use non-uniform background distribution, provide your own function.}

\item{unaligned_penalty}{distance for unaligned columns at edges of matrixes. See divergencePenaltyForUnaligned as an example for providing your own function}

\item{try_reverse_complement}{If false the alignment will not be performed on reverse complements. If true, the input pwms should have column order of ACTG.}

\item{length_normalization}{If true, will minimize the average divergence between PWMs. Otherwise will minimize the sum of divergences between positions. In both cases unalignes positions are compared to base_distribution and are counted when computing the alignment length.}

\item{PWM}{is a matrix of type matrix}
}
\value{
list of length two containing the alignment and the divergence
}
